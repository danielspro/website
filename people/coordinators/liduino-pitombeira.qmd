## Research
**Planejamento composicional: reflexões teórico-estéticas no âmbito de uma produção artística formalizada** (*Compositional Planning: Theoretical-Aesthetic Reflections in the Context of a Formalized Artistic Production*)

In this research project, we propose an expansion of previous projects conducted at the Graduate Program in Music of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (PPGM/UFRJ), which focused exclusively on the development of descriptive models (systemic modeling, 2015-2018 project) and the construction of prescriptive models (compositional systems, 2019-2022 project). In this new research, we aim to concentrate on Compositional Planning, which draws from a diverse range of paradigms (including interdisciplinarity), as a concept that interweaves textual and musical reflections and productions. This approach will extend the activities carried out in the two prior projects, which resulted in a significant output of bibliographic and compositional materials, laying the groundwork for the exploration we now propose.
