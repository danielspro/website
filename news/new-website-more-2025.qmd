The MusMat Research Group kicks off 2025 with exciting news! Our website has a fresh new look, offering a smoother and more intuitive navigation experience. We've also added a search tool (the magnifying glass in the upper right corner) to help users easily find content on the page.

If you have published a paper with us in *MusMat â€¢ Brazilian Journal of Music and Mathematics*, we have maintained the same URLs as the previous website. This means that even after the migration, links redirecting to articles, including DOIs, will continue to work perfectly.

Finally, two last announcements: we are working on migrating the journal to the OJS platform, streamlining and professionalizing the submission, review, and publication processes; and the second season of the MusMat Podcast (in Portuguese) is now live! We are currently on a short break due to academic holidays, but new episodes will be coming soon. You can check out the new episodes on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MusMat/videos) or on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/39BGsP5zoPjA2xFZU7aBqO).

See you soon!
