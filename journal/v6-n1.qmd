### Three Open Questions from the Indigenous Epistemology, over Music and Mathematics in the Latin American 21st Century
**Gabriel Pareyon**
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract</strong>: It is a fact that the ancient peoples of the Americas had, for many centuries, robust mathematical and musical cultures. Although much of these cultures was not clearly recorded in writing by the first European settlers, this does not mean that their existence is insignificant, and much less, that they have been lost forever. Due to the importance of publishing studies on music and mathematics from a Latin American perspective, the following text, initiatory on the subject, proposes three key questions to promote a discussion from anthropological and historical foundations for the indigenous relationships of music and mathematics, and with the intention of motivating more questions, or formulating them in a better way, in further research.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Keywords</strong>: <em> Mathematical Musicology. Latin America. Mesoamerican Mathematics and Music. </em></p>
