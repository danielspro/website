### Music as a Carbon Language: Clarifying Methods, Results, Fresh Data and Perspectives
**Gabriel Pareyon**
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract</strong>: From a cross-domain perspective, this article recapitulates fundamental concepts and procedures exposed in the antecedent homonymous paper (MusMat, first issue, 2016: 25–43). Firstly, the methodology used and here improved becomes explicit. An advanced section clarifies aspects that remained obscure in the first article. This theoretical approach falls entirely into the domain of study of the nuclear precession frequencies or Larmor frequencies in the NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) context, here incorporated to biomusicology. The structure obtained is a freescale geometric set and its generalization interprets the frequencies as a system of harmonically organized patterns. Intermediate findings provide arguments to strengthen the conjecture that the transversality of harmonic phenomena is related to a tendency towards structural self-similarity, without necessarily implying spurious relationships between causation and correlation.</p>
